# home-server

My cursed IoT server :)

Nobody should probably use this, but please feel free to take inspiration.
The behavior of messages sent over MQTT is heavily tied to cursed arduino
spaghetti code I wrote and deployed to some ESP8266s connected to custom
circuits (custom PCBs for the thermostat!)
